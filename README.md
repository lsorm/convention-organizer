# convention-organizer
This program allows a user to create a database and tables for conventions/events, and insert, delete, view, and update the event details.

The conventions are stored in a database, and the events (Autographs, Photo ops, Panels, etc), with all of the event details
(Name, date, time, room, price, notes) are stored in tables. 

For example, Autographs would be one table, with each Artist/Writer's details such as the date/time/room/price as an entry in the table.
